BOSTON House Price Prediction


Problem Statement: Price prediction
    The goal of the dataset is to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the ‘SalePrice’ variable and the submissions are to be evaluated on Mean_Absolute_Error.

Steps involved into developing this model

1. Remove Columns with unique values
2. Missing data treatment.
3. Pre-processing on data such as One Hot Encoding for categorical columns and Standardization for continuous columns.
4. Diving the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Checking correlation with other columns in the dataset and perform Feature Selection to get best features for the model.


Models used for predictions:
1. Linear Regression 
2. Lasso 
3. Ridge
